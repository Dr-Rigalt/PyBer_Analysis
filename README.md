# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹
Create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Resources ðŸ”§

* Data Source: city_data.csv & ride_data.csv
* Softaware: Anaconda Navigator 2.1.0 & Jupiter Notebook 6.4.3

## Summary & Results ðŸ“„

We analyzed data with 2,374 lines and the columns as follows 'city	date',	'fare',	'ride_id', 	'driver_count',	which was 
the result of merging two data sets, city_data.csv and ride_data.csv.

### The following table shows the aggregate of the city types crossed with each of the metrics obtained:

* Urban city types have the highest number of trips, drivers and rates, however the average rate per trip and per driver are the lowest compared to other city types.

* On the other hand, rural cities have the lowest number of trips, drivers and rates accumulated in the period, and paradoxically they have the highest average rates per trip and per driver.

### The following graph shows a comparison of the total rates by city type during the period between January 1st and April 24th, 2019:

* The seasonality behavior over the period is very similar between the 3 types of city.

* The most notable feature among the 3 typical cities is the peak at the end of February. The rest of the period is fairly constant.
